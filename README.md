## Description
This repository includes both backend and frontend of a bidirectional infinite-scrollable list. 
Technologies involved:
1. MongoDB - document database
2. Express(TS) - Node.js web framework
3. React(TS) - a client-side JavaScript framework
4. Node(TS) - the premier JavaScript web server

## Leftovers
There are a few things I have not implemented yet:
1. Edit or duplicate functionalities (delete was implemented).
2. Semantics - styling the action buttons a little prettier.

## Known Bugs
Update: All previous bugs were fixed. I have not found more yet.

## Run instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. run "npm install" and then "npm start" in both promotions_manager/backend and promotions_manager/frontend folders.
3. NOTE: the backend should run on port 3001.
