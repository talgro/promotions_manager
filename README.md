## Description
This Repository includes both backend and frontend of a bi-directinal infinate-scrollable list.
Technologies involved:
*MongoDB - document database/n
*Express(TS) - Node.js web framework
*React(TS) - a client-side JavaScript framework
*Node(TS) - the premier JavaScript web server

## Leftovers
There a few things I didn't implement:
1. Edit or duplicate a record (delete action was implemented).
2. Semantics - parsing the dates, styling the action buttons a little prettier.

## Known Bugs
There a few known bugs:
1. inifinate loader after clicking on "generate mock data" button - it works, just need to refresh the page.
2. After deleting a record, the list does not being updated - need to refresh.
